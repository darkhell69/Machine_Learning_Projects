### **Project Title: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python**

The Car Price Prediction project focuses on building a machine learning model to estimate the selling price of used cars based on various key attributes. With the growing online used-car market, predicting accurate car prices helps sellers set fair prices and buyers make informed decisions. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipelineâ€”from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and optimization.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Objective:**
To develop a regression model that predicts car prices using features such as brand, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, engine size, kilometers driven, and ownership history.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Tools and Libraries Used:**
- **Python** â€“ Programming language for data manipulation and modeling  
- **pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** â€“ Data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation  
- **LabelEncoder**, **OneHotEncoder** â€“ Encoding categorical variables  
- **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**, **Random Forest Regressor** â€“ Supervised learning models for regression  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection & Loading:**  
   The dataset was collected from online car listing platforms (e.g., Kaggle, OLX, CarDekho) and loaded using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Removed irrelevant columns and duplicate records  
   - Handled missing values using imputation strategies  
   - Converted categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, transmission) using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding  
   - Derived new features like car age from the manufacturing year

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized price trends across car brands and models  
   - Analyzed correlations between numerical features and car price  
   - Detected and handled outliers in mileage and price data

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Trained multiple regression models, including **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, **Lasso**, and **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - Evaluated models using metrics like **RÂ² Score**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
   - **Random Forest** yielded the best performance with balanced bias-variance trade-off
